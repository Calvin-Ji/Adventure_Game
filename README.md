## Contributions
Before starting the project, we evenly distributed tasks among all team members. Each time someone made changes, they
pushed their changes to the repository and committed with descriptions of what was changed. Later, these changes were
merged into the main branch. At the end, we counted the number of changes made by everyone as contributions. While
there may be some slight variations in the number of changes, in reality, our workload was roughly the same.
